# Terraform Module for Aetherium Validator

This Terraform module is designed to set up the necessary infrastructure for a Aetherium validator on AWS. It automates the creation of resources such as ECS clusters, VPCs, subnets, and security groups required for running a validator node.

> **Note:** This module is intended to be an example of running a validator for a core supported network. You may have to modify the validator module to support more advanced configurations. It is recommended to test thoroughly before using in a production environment.
